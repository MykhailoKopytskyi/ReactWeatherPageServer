# Proxy server for [React Weather app](https://github.com/MykhailoKopytskyi/ReactWeatherPageClient)
The weather API prevents the browser from accessing the response by setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin to a single client (which is obviosuly not my client).
Hence, this small app acts as a proxy server between the my client app and the main weather API.
